Feel free to use any code you find useful! All assets...the flower and the vine were made by me in Affinity!
This site's purpose is for me to have a place I can share my photos and also as a template for my recipes website I will make later this year!

This site is using the following stack:
For frontend:
  HTML -> ...
  
  CSS w/tailwind -> make it pretty
  
  Js -> in-browser functions

For backend:
  Django w/ python -> backend connectivity through restAPI with CRUD functionality for admin side of the website
  
  PostgresQL -> storing picture data (ez setup with django)
  
  CLoudinary -> for picture compression without fidelity loss

Hosts:
  frontend host = Netlify
  backend/database host = Railway
